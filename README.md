I recently completed a 2D game development project titled "Witch Survival" using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework. This game is a fast-paced survival experience where players defend themselves against waves of enemies while managing health and score. Throughout this project, I applied my skills in game development, object-oriented programming, and multimedia management to create an immersive gameplay experience.

- Game Mechanics:
  Designed player-controlled shooting mechanics and enemy AI that spawn dynamically, adding unpredictability to the gameplay.
- Graphics and Animation:
  Utilized SFML for rendering custom textures and sprites for characters, enemies, weapons, and backgrounds. Implemented smooth animations for various in-game actions.
- User Interface:
  Developed an intuitive menu system, in-game HUD for health and score tracking, and a "Game Over" screen.
- Audio Integration:
  Integrated background music and sound effects to enhance the gaming experience, using custom music for different game states (menu, gameplay, credits).
- Collaboration:
  Worked in a team, contributing to both the technical coding aspects and creative design, including the design of custom character images and names for the credits screen.

This project was an exciting opportunity to strengthen my skills in game development, working with real-time rendering, animation, and audio management in a collaborative team environment.
